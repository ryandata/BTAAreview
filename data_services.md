## BTAA Data Services

### 2023-10-05

For each institution, I looked for individuals providing Public Data Services (**PDS**), and for those providing  Research Data Management (**RDM**) services.  Loosely speaking, we can consider Public Data Services (PDS) help researchers and students locate and use existing data sources and data software, while Research Data Management (RDM) services as focusing on helping researchers manage, organize, and share their own data created from their research .

### Illinois

### **3** in PDS
### **0 or 14** in RDM (none in Libraries, but another unit of 14 provides similar services)

Has specialized data repository, [Illinois Data Bank](https://databank.illinois.edu/). 576 items, steadily increasing by year (over 100/yr now)

Has an [Open Scholarship](https://openscholarship.indiana.edu/) portal including Open Data section. 

Formally organized [Research Data Service](https://researchdataservice.illinois.edu/) centered on Research Data Management with 3 staff and one graduate assistant.

- Director, Research Data Service
- Associate Director, Research Data Service
- Data Librarian
- Graduate Assistant

Public Data Services are run out of the [Scholarly and Media Commons]() which was the result of a merger between the Scholarly Commons and the Media Commons.  Their data-focused person retired recently, and some programs, like data purchase, seem to be in retreat.  There are 5 staff here, and 6 graduate assistants, but it appears most of them support technology not data.  Workshops are run from the space, but can be delivered by any campus group, not just libraries.  I would only list one person as having a definite role in public data support:

- Interim Manager, Scholarly Commons and Media Commons Coordinator

Other workshops and assistance with finding data and consultations are run out of the [Center for Innovation in Teaching & Learning](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/data-analytics/workshops), which has a Director of Data Analytics, and 13 [other staff](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/data-analytics/meet-our-staff) from across the university covering stats packages, methodology, and sources (like their ICPSR OR),  but this is not under the Libraries, although they partner with Libraries to offer workshops and consultations in the Libraries.

### Indiana

### **3** in PDS
### **1** in RDM

Has general repository, [IUScholarWorks](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/) that accepts research data

Has an [Open Scholarship](https://openscholarship.indiana.edu/) portal including Open Data section. 

They have a [Scholars' Commons](https://libraries.indiana.edu/scholars-commons) as a focal point for help, but their programming has very little data content, and very little other content as well

Note: Indiana and Maryland are using identical web templates

- Data Librarian
- Map and Spatial Data Librarian
- Research Impact & Open Scholarship Librarian
- Visual Literacy and Resources Librarian

Indiana also has a world class [Area Studies](https://libraries.indiana.edu/area-studies) group and a [Curator of Puzzles](https://libraries.indiana.edu/andrew-rhoda)

### Iowa

### **2** in PDS
### **2** in RDM

Has general repository, [Iowa Research Online](https://research.its.uiowa.edu/) that accepts research data (95 items only)

[Research Services](https://research.its.uiowa.edu/) from their IT manages all data software workshops, not Libraries.

In general, Iowa seems pretty undeveloped on the data front, but they do pull their services together in a clean, well-described bundle

- Data Services Librarian
- Director, Scholarly Impact (listed as Research Data contact, counting as RDM)
- Engineering & Informatics Librarian (listed as Research Data contact, counting as RDM)
- GIS Specialist

There are Digital Project Librarians and a Scholarly Communications Librarian, but it is difficult to identify anyone focused on data management in a focused way.

### Maryland

### **1** in PDS
### **0** in RDM

Has general repository, [DRUM](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/). Yes, it is the same name as Minnesota, who had one first.  Takes data up to 15GB with file size up to 2GB. Their "equitable access" policy passed in 2022.

has [Research Services](https://www.lib.umd.edu/research/services) and [Data Services](https://www.lib.umd.edu/research/data)

Research Services is research guides, citation tools, systematic reviews, consultations with subject specialists but also
statistical consulting and "GIS and Data Service Center"

Data Services includes DMP, Data Repositories, ICPSR, Data Citation, and Open Data resources

2 days, 2 hours in afternoon each, there is a walk-in Data Help Desk

Their data services are GIS-centric and radiate out from there (R and Python are described as GIS workshops on slides).  

Interesting idea - they advertise their open help desk hours as calendar events as well

Their services (e.g., [statistical consulting](https://lib.umd.edu/research/services/statistical-consulting) are very well described, including their mission and goals.

However, staffing seems very limited.  Services hide behind generic e-mails.  Statistical consulting appears to be done by graduate students.  There is also a data services graduate assistant. There is a DRUM graduate assistant.  Presumably administrators are involved in higher level direction setting (e.g., Head, Open Scholarship Servces)

A GIS lab exists

In terms of staffing, only one active person is identified.  There is a vacant Data Services Librarian on their org chart.  There is an Open Science/STEM Librarian, but their job synopsis does not refer to Open Science or Data work.

- GIS and Data Librarian

Side comment:
There is a dedicate "Patents and Trademarks Librarian" without other responsibilities.  But he retired in 2012 and now works 10 hours a week in this [role](https://www.lib.umd.edu/about/contact/directory/jim-miller).

### Michigan

### **5** providing PDS
### **7** providing RDM

Has repository ([Deep Blue](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data))

- Data Curation Specialist for Science and Engineering
- Data Curation Specialist for Workflows and Big Data

plus four additional librarians supporting "Data Management"

- Biological Sciences Librarian

### **3** providing RDM

3 listed as advisors for "Research Data Management Guidance"

- Digital Scholarship (also part of Digital Scholarship Lab)
- Electronic Resources
- Head, Digital Scholarship Lab (also part of Digital Scholarship Lab)

RDM and PDS delivered through [Data Scholarship Lab](https://lib.msu.edu/dsl/)

In addition to the above, these deliver PDS:

- Assistant Director, Digital Humanities @ MSU
- Data Librarian
- Digital Humanities Archivist
- GIS Librarian
- Head, Digitial Development and Strategies
- Health Sciences Librarian
- Transformative Technologies Coordinator

### Minnesota

### **3** providing PDS
### **4** providing RDM

Has a data repository, [DRUM](https://conservancy.umn.edu/pages/drum/)

"DRUM is a publicly available collection of digital research data generated by U of M researchers, students, and staff. Anyone can search and download the data housed in the repository, instantly or by request.

The Data Repository accepts submissions from University affiliates for digital archiving and access. Learn more about depositing to the Data Repository and other services to manage your data."

A bit difficult to pinpoint data services, which are not highlighted on their pages.  Browsing staff directory comes up with these identified titles, but may miss liaison librarians who play a role with data:

- Computational Research Librarian 
- Data Curation Librarian
- Data Librarian (RDM focused)
- Director, Open Research & Publishing (dept. includes Research Data Services, Publishing Services, Research Information Management, and houses the Data Curation Network)
- Geospatial, Technical and Data Lead, Mapping Prejudice 
- Map & Geospatial Information Librarian
- Spatial Data Analyst and Curator 
- Research Data Services Lead and Director of DRUM 

not counting
- Director, Data Curation Network (based at MN but we could be members)

### Nebraska

### **1** providing PDS
### **1** providing RDM

Has a data repository, [UNLDR](https://dataregistry.unl.edu/)

"UNL Data Repository was created to provide for the growing requirements by external funding agencies for data management and data sharing. This repository, designed to provide researchers with a secure site for storage of data collections that are no longer actively in use, allows the researcher to stably retain data for future use and/or sharing with other interested parties. The UNLDR exists to manage data in a manner that facilitates research and scholarly activities, and that simplifies access to vital and unique research data."

As seen in other contexts, Nebraska is **much** smaller than other BTAA peers and is not really an appropriate comparator.

Rather opaque services, a lot of them hiding behind generic email addresses, suggesting understaffing.  Only the following two positions among library faculty are clearly data-related, however some of their other faculty (Chair, Research Partnerships) may have data-related roles.

- Geospatial Data and Programs Librarian
- Research Data Services and Science Librarian

### An Ohio State University

### **8** providing PDS
### **1** providing RDM

Institutional repository, [Knowledge Bank](https://library.osu.edu/kb) accepts data (1 GB or less, see [recommended procedures for data](https://library.osu.edu/kb/recommended-procedures-for-data)

Primary point of service for research data services is the [Research Commons](https://library.osu.edu/researchcommons). This site is a model for presenting both services and personnel in a friendly, informative, and helpful way.

- Data Literacy and Visualization Librarian
- Data Visualization Specialist 
- Digital Humanities Librarian
- Geospatial Information Librarian
- Public Services Coordinator
- Publishing and Repository Services Libraria
- Research Commons Program Manager
- Research Data Librarian
- Research Impact Librarian

also in Research Commons (not counting these as Data Services):

- Copyright Services Coordinator
- Office of Technology and Digital Innovation Library Services Liaison and Copyright Specialist (this is one person)

and a linkage to their version of OARC (Ohio Supercomputer Center)

### Penn State

### **7** providing PDS
### **2** providing RDM

(those counts do not include part-time or open publishing. Although it is not clearly delineated, I am counting the unit head and the STEM research data librarian on the RDM side of the ledger)

Institutional repository, [ScholarSphere](https://scholarsphere.psu.edu/) accepts data.

Both RDM and PDS served up out of [Research Informations and Publishing](https://libraries.psu.edu/about/departments/research-informatics-and-publishing) unit

"The Department of Research Informatics and Publishing enhances the technology-driven teaching and research capacity of the Penn State community. We partner with students, faculty, and staff to consult, provide training, and support projects in the areas of research data management, digital humanities, mapping, statistical analysis, and open publishing."

[Research Data Services](https://libraries.psu.edu/research/research-data-services)

- Digital Library Software Developer
- Research Data System Manager

One Assistant Professor for "Data Services" in addition to Digital Humanities and other subject areas.

One Associate Professor and GIS Specialist

Associate Professor and Engineering Information Specialist is responsible for data management libguide for undergraduates.  Not counting this towards staffing numbers above since it may not be a major responsiblity.

GIS workshop links to 2014 presentation slides.

Interestingly, even [PURR](https://purr.purdue.edu) service is highlighting its advice on data plans more than data deposit.

### Wisconsin

### **8** providing PDS
### **9** providing RDM

Has an Institutional repository, [MINDS@UW](https://www.library.wisc.edu/research-support/minds/) accepts data, also offer Dryad.

[Research Data Services](https://researchdata.wisc.edu/) consists of nine individuals on the [RDS Team](https://researchdata.wisc.edu/rds-team/) from both Libraries and IT:

- Data & Digital Scholarship Manager and Chair, Research Data Services
- Data & Digital Scholarship Librarian
- Data, Network, and Translation Research Librarian
- Director, Research Cyberinfrastruce (IT)
- Information Architecture Librarian, interests in FAIR
- Instructional Technology Program Manager and Consultant (IT)
- Librarian for Scandinavian Humanities and South Asian Studies, interests in digital humanities
- Research Cyberinfrastructure Storage Lead (IT)
- Science and Engineering Librarian, interests in open science

"Research Data Services (RDS) supports UW-Madison researchers as they gather, manage, and share their research data to make their data citable, reproducible, and publicly accessible. Our consultants have a wide variety of research data management and sharing expertise and provide training, one-on-one help and referrals to resources and other campus support units. "  Formed in 2009.

[The Data & Information Services Center](https://www.disc.wisc.edu/) is a social science data center along "traditional" early 2000s style lines. "DISC provides quantitative, numeric microdata for researchers and students conducting secondary analysis in the social sciences. For DISC users not familiar with statistical software, we have an array of data products with menu-based interfaces. Longitudinal surveys, macroeconomic indicators, election studies, population studies, socialization patterns, poverty measures, labor force participation, public opinion polls, education and health data, and census data comprise the scope of the collection. "

In addition, four librarians are listed as being able to help locate social science data:

- Senior Special Librarian, Data & Information Services Center  (two of these)
- Government Information Reference Librarian
- Anthropology, Folkore, & Sociology Librarian

Combing through their personnel directory, we also find
- Data, Science & Engineering Diversity Resident Librarian (Science Library)
- Data Strategist (probably not providing data services, so not counting this one)
- Map & Geospatial Data Librarian
- Reference & Data Librarian (Business Library)
- Research Data Librarian (Health Library)

Wisconsin offers ungraded online "[micro-courses](https://learn.library.wisc.edu/micro-courses/)" in areas including RDM, copyright, patents, and data sharing.

Wisconsin also has a [Data Science Hub](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub/) that is another place that offers workshops, events, and meetups around data.
