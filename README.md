## Purdue

The Purdue main website lists "Inclusion" as a top-level header right up there with "Academics", "Admissions", and "Athletics".  Sad to see Rutgers lagging behind Purdue in this area.

[Directory](https://www.lib.purdue.edu/directory)

Purdue lists Librarians by their professorial rank, without area-specific titles.  So classification is by their liaison/expertise identified in their profiles.  Purdue is not comparable to Rutgers for many reasons.

[Staff by location](https://www.library.wisc.edu/about/directory/staff-by-location/#0) is the best way to zoom on specific staff in each area.

[library location list](https://www.library.wisc.edu/locations/#)

See, for example:
* AMP for Astronomy, Math, Physics
* Business
* College Library for Undergraduate
* Memorial Library for Humanities and Social Sciences
* Schwerdtfeger for Earth and Planetary Sciences
* Steenbock for Agriculture, Engineering, Life Sciences

Note there are some exceptions - Chemistry Librarian is based in the Chemistry Building, not a library
